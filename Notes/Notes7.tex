\begin{itemize}

  \item Rank-Order:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Apply weights to the design goals

      \item Formulate a scheme to assign ratings to each design concept

      \item Combine those weights and ratings to score each solution

      \item Compare those scores to identify the best overall solution

    \end{itemize}

  \item Decision Matrix:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Results from the formula $DF = WF\cdot RF$, where $DF$ is the decision factor, $WF$ is the weighting factors, and $RF$ is the rating factor

      \item Come up with different designs and rate them on a 1-10 scale (1 being poor and 10 being excellent) in their fulfillment of ranking categories

      \item Create a table and sum up the decision factors for each category â€” the highest number is the best design

    \end{itemize}

  \item Kepner-Tregoe (KT) Approach

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Decide which problem to address

      \item Decide the best solution

      \item Decide how to avoid additional problems

      \item Evaluation Criteria:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Timing

            \begin{itemize}

              \item How urgent is the problem?

            \end{itemize}

          \item Trend

            \begin{itemize}

              \item What is the problem's potential for growth

            \end{itemize}

          \item Impact

            \begin{itemize}

              \item How serious is the problem?

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Kepner-Tregoe (KT) Decision Analysis

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Write a concise decision statement

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Identify what you are trying to accomplish and what resources are available

        \end{itemize}

      \item List all the objectives

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Musts

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Mandatory to achieving a successful solution

            \end{itemize}

          \item Wants

            \begin{itemize}

              \item Wants are desirable but don't affect overall success

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item Develop a list of solutions or options

        \begin{itemize}

          \item This would be the results of all of your ideation

        \end{itemize}

      \item Evaluate the solutions against the musts

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Simple go or no go

        \end{itemize}

      \item Incorporate the wants and assign weights

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Apply a rating to the wants

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Kepner-Tregoe (KT) Potential Problem Analysis

    \begin{itemize}

      \item List potential problems, potential causes, preventative actions, and contingent actions in a table

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
