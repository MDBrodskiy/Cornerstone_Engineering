\begin{itemize}

  \item What do engineers do?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Use science and technology to solve problems to benefit society

      \item Creates a ``triangle'' between science, technology, and society

    \end{itemize}

  \item Perspective

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Understanding the relationship between technology and society

    \end{itemize}

  \item Analysis

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Understanding the role of values in engineering practice

    \end{itemize}

  \item Application

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Understanding the core ethical concepts and theories as well as applying them

    \end{itemize}

  \item Professional Responsibility

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Understanding and embodying the professional standards and codes of your respective disciplines

    \end{itemize}

  \item Trolley Problem

  \item Incorporating Ethics is a Skill

    \begin{itemize}

    \item Choosing a project

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Social/ecological vs.\ technical problems

          \item Framing factors: resources, expertise, institutional context

          \item Opportunity costs (priorities) as value expressions

          \item Prevention vs.\ treatment (eliminating causes vs.\ dealing with effects)

          \item Non-technical alternatives

        \end{itemize}

    \item Defining success

    \item Understanding means and byproducts

      \begin{itemize}

        \item Unacceptable means

          \begin{itemize}

            \item The ends do not always justify the means (Tuskegee; animal experimentation)

          \end{itemize}

        \item Unintended byproducts/Secondary effects

          \begin{itemize}

            \item Privacy and RFID/Nano IT

            \item Ecological effects and Life Cycle Assessment

            \item Silver nanoparticles (antimicrobial) in washing machines affect water treatment which rely on microbials

            \item Synthetic artemisinin, malarial resistance, and wormwood farmers

            \item Synthetic genomics and biosecurity/biosafety

          \end{itemize}

      \end{itemize}
