  \item What is Problem Solving?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Problems are at the center of what many people do at work every day

        \begin{itemize}

          \item \textit{e.g.} Solving a problem for a client

          \item Supporting those who are solving problems

          \item Discovering new problems to solve

        \end{itemize}

      \item Being a confident problem solver is really important to your success in your career

      \item We need a good process to use $\Rightarrow$ Engineering Design Process (EDP)

    \end{itemize}

  \item What is Engineering Design?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Intelligent Process $\rightarrow$ Learn and improve

      \item Find a solution that:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Achieves user needs $\rightarrow$ Identify the user and their needs

          \item Meets client's objectives $\rightarrow$ Identify the client and the objectives

          \item Meets defined constraints $\rightarrow$ Identify and evaluate the constraints based on client requirements

        \end{itemize}

        \newpage

      \item We will follow: Problem $\rightarrow$ Define $\rightarrow$ Generate $\rightarrow$ Decide $\rightarrow$ Implement $\rightarrow$ Evaluate
