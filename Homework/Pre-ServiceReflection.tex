\maketitle

\paragraph{} To be honest, when I signed up, I was unaware that this section was service learning, nor did I know what service learning was; however, given our service learning topic, I am quite excited to get children involved in the world of robotics. Throughout my scientific career, I knew that advising from people more experienced in my fields of interest than I would put me on a fast track for success, yet I never actually received much help. As such, I am elated at the fact that I'm going to be helping younger kids learn more about technology. In this manner, I hope my experience with robotics may help the kids learn more.

\paragraph{} Most importantly, whether robotics or not, I want the kids' interest in technology to rise, and, hopefully, get more of them involved in STEM-related activities. As service learning pertains to me, I hope to learn how to be patient with people I work â€” something which I can definitely learn from working with kids. In any case, I hope to get as many people as possible interested in STEM.
