  The idea behind this demo is that it compares several of the variables involved to reaction time, while still giving the user some control over the data. There are two inputs, \textsc{hand}, which sets the handedness of the user as a constraint, and \textsc{N}, which limits the data arrays to size \textsc{N}\footnote{NOTE: setting \textsc{N} too large causes a mismatch in array sizes}. Four tiled scatterplots are generated: Return time, first move time, moving time, and age versus reaction time. The attached example runs \textsc{ML3H2\_MBROD(``r'', 50)}. See below for a flowchart.
