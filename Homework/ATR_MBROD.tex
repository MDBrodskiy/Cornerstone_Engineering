  \item Blackjack Dealer Flowchart for $n$ players:

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering \include{Figures/Blackjack.tex}
      \caption{Flowchart for a Blackjack Dealer with $n$ players}
      \label{fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    \scriptsize \paragraph{} Initially, I had only the dealer perspective (where the dealer would draw to 17 or greater), and no actual player interaction. This was too simple, and not much of a game, so the player interaction, with $n$ players, was added to make it more like the real game, and add complexity. Evaluation of who wins and who loses still omitted (simplified as ``Payouts/losses''). Additionally, the dealer asking for insurance added more complexity, in addition to an integral part of the game.
