        \State Define serial port and e-mail to create HumanReaction object

        \State Notify subject to use dominant hand first
        \State Run \textsc{HRtrial} with the created object, dominant hand, and amount of trials entered
        \State Notify subject to use non-dominant hand first
        \State Run \textsc{HRtrial} with the created object, non-dominant hand, and amount of trials entered
        \State Run \textsc{HRaverages} to retrieve class set averages
