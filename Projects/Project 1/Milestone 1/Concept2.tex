\paragraph{} The blow launcher is quite simple by design, allowing it to be made from a variety of materials, and to be quite light. The user holds the blowgun at the handle and uses their thumb to reload. Once reloaded, the user blows into the opening, launching the ball. The simplicity of the design makes it easily reproducible as well.
