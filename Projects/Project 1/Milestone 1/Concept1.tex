\paragraph{} The concentric tube launcher contains an inner and outer barrel for single-handed reloading. Pressing down on the inner barrel collapses it, pushing back two rubber bands. These bands are held in place by a hook attached to a trigger. A ping pong ball is then loaded into the inner barrel. Pulling the trigger releases the bands, propelling the ball, which is loose inside the inner barrel, and launching it.
