  \caption{A depiction of the simple encryption game. The encryption standard (to be simple and guessable) will be plus or minus-based for easy/medium modes, and multiplication/division based for hard mode. For data purposes, the standard will be recorded as $<$\textsc{operation}$><$\textsc{integer}$>$; for example a standard of a character times 5 would be *5. An optional hint can be displayed if stuck that lets player two know which operation is being used. The exhibit itself will have more information, with text and images, describing the history of encryption and modern counterparts, and possible other interactive elements (some ideas are being developed). An alternate single player version could have a database of phrases, with difficulty corresponding to phrase length and attempts to guess until failure.}
